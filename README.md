Allows the publishing of jupyter notebooks into a html file which is then displayed in a dashboard-esque layout

Using python comments to 'position' each output to the left (# nbi:left) or right (# nbi:right), allowing for basic positioning functionality for the notebook

May be useful but currently displays an error message when loading widgets in the html files

Alternatively, use ipywidget layout functions HBox VBox to format widget positions <------ best candidate so far

Further things to try: 

- https://github.com/oschuett/appmode ----> displays notebook as an app?

- https://github.com/damianavila/RISE ----> displays notebook as a slideshow
