,BU,What else can we do to be a better bank?
0,BPB,Don't forget that your staff are your customers too and always give them the best deals e.g. interest rates in the market - without having to be asked to do it.
1,BPB,Organise proper training for new staff and have a clear outline of the program
2,BPB,Customer comes first
3,BPB,"Some of the data we are now forced to rely on for our new KPIs does not appear to be flowing correctly enough, or quickly enough for us to manage these KPIs effectively. Our trust in some of the data we rely on is being diminished. There seems to have been a rush to push out new measurements without the back-end of our systems being able to handle the reporting."
4,BPB,"Employ sufficient workforce on the frontline and back ends to ensure everyone has the time to meet risk and compliance standards as well as customer expectations.  With more support staff, it would be expected that frontline staff would spend less time following up and correcting errors.  With more frontline staff, it would be expected that staff make less mistakes from being time poor. I understand that more staff is not always the answer but I've seen productivity issues in the last 12 months as a direct result of staff cuts/processing team closures."
5,BPB,better pay
6,BPB,"Refine how we present our Offer Letter BFD for commercial. We need to highlight and bold the charging of an establishment feeto the customer and not have it in a position where it can be perceived to be hiding. The establishment fee is in normal text whilst directly beneath it minimal fees are in bold text, drawing the customers attention away from the larger establishment fee.  "
7,BPB,"So much Home Loan focus. No matter what else you do it you haven't uncovered Home Loan opportunities it is not good enough. I do not see how this is compliant with our vision of focusing on client needs, instead we are essentially told to focus on this home loan number. I also don't think it is congruent with our stated aim of removing targets. I get why targets exist but as an organisation is dishonest to say we are getting rid of them when they are so heavily emphasised but just rebranded as 'activities'."
8,BPB,"More staff!!!  If you want to be a better and simpler Bank, and to ""get stuff done"", allow more staff for teams.  You will see faster turnaround times, staff less under pressure and making errors, which will result in happier customers.  The Bank is concerned about expenses involved, yet we make record profits at the expense of reduced staff levels.  I debated about whether to include th
ese comments as the general consensus is nothing will get done about it anyway as profits come first."
9,BPB,"The bank can concentrate on improving the way that employees promotion is based more on merit rather then who they are friends within management. Its important to network, but unfair to be able to get a role with little or no experience based on being social. The bank needs to ensure we are being fair on promotion within the business as a whole and promote managers that take the time to listen to individuals rather then just concentrating on other items"
